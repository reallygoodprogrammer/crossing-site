# saplove site

This is the middleman/p5js project I've created for my site hosted
that you can find [here](https://saplove.nekoweb.org). I love websites.

## things to do

- create way to interact with db
  - p5js sketch?
  - straight search, tags, random buttons?
  - ethereal mind-drifting techniques?
