**CLICK THE 'recent' OR 'random' buttons on the side to view pages.**

I like to find sites on the internet, typically this involves
scraping other sources. I've decided to put all my scraps into one place
where they can either be viewed randomly or by the most recent.

Given my methods for finding these sites, I can't say I support any of 
these pages or artists since I haven't looked through all of these pages 
individually. This is not my curated list, although I will remove things I 
don't like or want on here if I see something.
