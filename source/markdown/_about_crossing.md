This is a page where I scrape website links from other sources. **Click
the 'recent' or 'random' buttons on the side to view pages.**

I am never able to find new artist pages without having to dig really
deep into social media or by doing something else that is tedious. I'd rather 
just have a page where I take urls that I scrape from a bunch of places (nicely 
of course), and put all these urls in one place that I can sift through randomly.

Given the methodology, I can't say I support any of these pages or artists since
I haven't looked through all of these pages individually. This is not
my curated list, although I will remove things I don't like or want on here if
I see something.
