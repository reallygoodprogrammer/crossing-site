This is a site I've made dedicated to the things I make, like,
aspire to, wish I could do, etc. This site is and always will be
a work in progress bc there's probably always something I will
want to change or add at some point in time.

I love making art and other things, so if you happen upon my website
and would like to make something w me, make a suggestion, critique
something of mine, say hi, or whatever, add a message in the guestbook
to the left of the page. :)

I also code things, which you can check out on my 
[github]("https://github.com/reallygoodprogrammer").
