## You are at saplove crossing

This is a site I'm making to share things, such as parts of the internet, 
tools, resources, etc etc. I am always open to suggestions for things to add 
(bc suprisingly, I don't know about everything that's out there). If you 
have a suggestion or just want to tell me something, add something in the 
guestbook (and add ur email too if u want a deeper conversation, I'm the only 
one that can see it).

# [*GO TO THE CROSSING*](crossing.html)

You can check out on my [github here](https://github.com/reallygoodprogrammer)
if that stuff interests you, including the code for rendering this site.
