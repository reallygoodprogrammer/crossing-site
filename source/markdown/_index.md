A lot of the content found on this site has been found through me scraping
vast parts of the internet and posting it here. I'll say this now: unless
I explicitly say that it's my content, *none of the sites outside this domain
are made or maintained by me in any way*. **I don't take responsibility for
any of the actions of the webpages I link on here**. This is merely a place
I've created for people to find other interesting things, not a space for
advertising others webpages, not a space to trick you, etc. I've attached
a [license for this project here](license.html).

This is a site I'm making to share things I find online. I am always open to 
suggestions for things to add (bc suprisingly, I don't know about everything 
that's out there). If you have a suggestion or just want to tell me something
cool, [email me here](mailto:spiritsvacancy@gmail.com)!

You can check out on my [github here](https://github.com/reallygoodprogrammer)
if that stuff interests you.
