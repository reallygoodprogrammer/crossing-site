*Mom*,

I wouldn't have been able to have learned or experienced so many of the 
things I cherish in life and continue to do so without your help and presence. 
You've helped me through the tough, exciting, and everything in between unconditionally,
and I will always be grateful for that. Having a mother as unique and caring as you
are is a blessing. Thank you for being my mom.

I love you.
