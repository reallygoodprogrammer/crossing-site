## resources and citations

The sites linked on here are found on either other currated lists, 
archives, or just fuzzing random domain names until something is found.

I'll try and keep this list of resources used up to date:

- [InternetIsBeautiful Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/)
- [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com) for search top level domains like .xyz, .club, etc
- [brutalist websites](https://brutalistwebsites.com) a site with links to 'brutalist-style' designed websites
    - I highly recommend looking through this site if this interests you, it contains a lot of interviews of designers and is just a really cool project
